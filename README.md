# PUBG Game Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting player performance and match outcomes in the popular battle royale game, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). PUBG is known for its dynamic gameplay and extensive data, making it an excellent candidate for data analysis and machine learning.

## Project Description

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a highly competitive game where players compete to be the last one standing in a battle royale environment. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to analyze and predict various aspects of PUBG matches, including player rankings, match winners, and player performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** We've collected a substantial dataset from PUBG matches, which includes information about players, their in-game actions, match characteristics, and outcomes.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The collected data is preprocessed to ensure it's clean and ready for machine learning. This includes handling missing data, feature engineering, and data normalization.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We explore the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis to gain insights into player behavior, game dynamics, and patterns.

- **Machine Learning Models:** We employ various machine learning models, such as regression, classification, and clustering, to predict different aspects of PUBG matches. For example, we use regression models to predict player kill counts and classification models to predict match winners.

- **Model Evaluation:** Our models are rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure their accuracy and performance.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Data Collection:** If you want to collect your own PUBG data, follow the data collection instructions provided in the `data_collection/` directory.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The `data_preprocessing/` directory contains scripts to preprocess and clean the data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset using Jupyter notebooks in the `eda/` directory.

4. **Machine Learning Models:** Train and test machine learning models to predict various aspects of PUBG matches in the `machine_learning/` directory.
